                Policy research in STI management at NACETEM is aimed at providing sound policy advice based on
                quality research evidences to policy makers in order to remove guesswork or opinion-driven 
                actions from governance. Of prominent importance to achieving this goal is NACETEM's ability 
                to: generate reliable and trustworthy evidence; improve usability of evidence; effectively 
                disseminate evidence and provide wide access to evidence. NACETEM has recorded considerable 
                achievements in policy research in STI Management, the highlight of which was the anchoring 
                of 2009-2011  Policy review and the subsequent organisation of the first international conference
                on evidence-informed policy making in collaboration with INASP and Wellcome Trust UK. 
                About 40 policy research projects including masters and PhD studies on topical national 
                issues have been completed by our research faculty in the last 10 years. The outcomes of policy 
                projects have been published in many scholarly journals, book-chapters,  edited books and monographs
                and a readily accessible at our library domiciled at the NACETEM headquarters.
