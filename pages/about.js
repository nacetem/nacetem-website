                            Advances in science and technology are being recorded at a dizzying
                            speed in our world today, and with the pivotal role of technology 
                            in development, there is an increasing need for technology management. 
                            Technology management entails planning, development, use and diffusion of 
                            technology as well as its application to the industry and its impacts on the social, 
                            economic, cultural, political and geographical environment of a nation. Any firm, 
                            industry or nation that places a premium on technology management sets itself up 
                            for rapid growth and development. With our nation's current drive to be a major player
                            in the global economy due to its human and natural endowments, as  well  as  the  country's
                            commitment  to  the  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable Development, the need for an aggressive
                            approach towards science and technology-driven development is more urgent than before. 
                        </Typography>
                        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
                            This  urgency is what makes NACETEM critical  to  Nigeria's development  
                            through science and technology.  To this end, NACETEM has developed several 
                            cutting-edge programmes  anchored  on  the  tripod  of  capacity  building, 
                            policy  research  and consultancy in the areas of Science, Technology and 
                            Innovation (STI) management. We therefore invite you to carefully go through 
                            this information brochure to avail yourself of what we do and how we do it as a

                            The National Centre for Technology Management (NACETEM) originated following a
                             recommendation of the 2nd Conference of Ministers responsible for Application
                              of Science and Technology to the socio-econimic establishment of Africa 
                              (CASTAFRICA II, 1987). They called for the develoopment and harmonization 
                              of human resources needed to promote, project and propagate technology management in Africa.

                            Consequently, NACETEM was established in September 1992 but commenced 
                            operations in January 1993, headed by a Drector, with the headquarters
                            located within the campus of the Obafemni Awolowo University (OAU), 
                            Ile-Ife, Osun state. This was to allow it leverage on the huge human 
                            resources, especially in Technology Management, available at the University.

                            In November 2005, following reforms of the National Science, Technology
                            and Innovation (STI) system by the Federal Government of Nigeria,
                            the original mandates of NACETEM were streamlined and re-structured
                            to cover activities in the West African sub-region and beyond the the 
                            merger of former Regional Programme for Technology Management (REPTEM) with NACETEM.

                            NACETEM was thereafter elevated to the status of a full agency headed
                            by a Director General/Chief Executive Officer. Consequently, REPTEM,
                            located in Lagos, was re-designated as the NACETEM South West Zonal office.
                            Five other zonal offices of the Centre have been established and have been 
                            in full operation in Abuja (North Central), Bayelsa (South South),
                                Kano (North West), Enugu (South East) and Yola (North East).
